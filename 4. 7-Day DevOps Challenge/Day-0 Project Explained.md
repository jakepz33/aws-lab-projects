# 7-Day DevOps Challenge!

Over the next 7 days, I'll build a complete CI/CD pipeline that takes code from commit to production, gaining practical DevOps skills.

**By the end of this challenge, I'll have:**
- Built a complete CI/CD pipeline using AWS tools
- Automated the testing and deployment of a real application
- Created 7 pieces of portfolio-worthy documentation that showcase these skills.

The challenge will consist of these 7 steps:
1. Set up a Web App in the Cloud
2. Connect a GitHub Repo with AWS
3. Store Dependencies in CodeArtifact
4. Package an App with CodeBuild
5. Deploy an App with CodeDeploy
6. Automate My Infrastructure with CloudFormation
7. CI/CD with CodePipeline

**What is DevOps?**
- it is a set of practices that combines development and operations to shorted development cycles and deliver reliable software.

Generally in an Organization they:
- Build automated pipelines (e.g. using AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitHub Actions) that test, pakage, and deploy software, so releases become faster and more reliable.
- Containerize application using tools like Docker and Kubernetes, which helps applications scale
- Turn cloud infrastructure into code (e.g. CloudFormation, Terraform), so teams can create and manage resources more efficiently than manually configuring them.

**What is CI/CD?**
The goal of CI/CD is to make the flow from code changes to a live application as efficient and reliable as possible. To do this, automations are set up across the software development and deployment process.
